https://unboxed-analytics.shinyapps.io/lyrics-profanity-analyzer/

A simple tool to quickly measure profanity in any song, based on lyrics from genius.com.

Some sample songs to try out:
- "Rap God" by Eminem: https://genius.com/Eminem-rap-god-lyrics
- "The London" by Young Thug: https://genius.com/Young-thug-the-london-lyrics
- "Money in the Grave" by Drake: https://genius.com/Drake-money-in-the-grave-lyrics

The offensive/profane word list used here was by developed by [Luis von Ahn](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/). As he notes on his [resource page](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/), "the list contains some words that many people won't find offensive, but it's a good start for anybody wanting to block offensive or profane terms on their Site."
